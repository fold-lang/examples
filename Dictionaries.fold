-- Dictionary is a hash-map

type Person =
  { name :: String
    age  :: Int
    city :: City }

dylan :: Person =
  { name => "Bob Dylan"
    age  => 32
    city => `London }

|| There are also structural run-time types (row polymorphism) that do not
|| require type definition.

p1 :: { `x :: Int, `y :: Int }
    = { `x => 231, `y => 500 }

|| The operator `=>` represents a pair, or an item. You can use items anywhere.

coordinate = `x => 23
